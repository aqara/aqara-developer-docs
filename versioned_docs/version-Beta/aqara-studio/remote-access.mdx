# Remote Access

## Feature Overview

By default, you can only access Aqara Studio within your local area network (LAN). When you need to connect from an external network, you can enable **remote access** to securely manage your smart home devices and control systems from anywhere.

## Prerequisites

Before using remote access, please ensure that you have logged in to your **Aqara Builder** account and bound a Workspace on the [Cloud Connect](./cloud.mdx) page.

## How to Obtain a Remote Access Address

1. Open [Aqara Builder](https://builder.aqara.com) and select your bound workspace at the top left.
2. In the left menu, click on **Studios**.
3. In the **Studio Instances & Projects** list, find the device corresponding to your Aqara Studio IP and click on its **Connect** button.
4. A new page will automatically open, displaying the remote access interface for your Aqara Studio. The URL shown in your browser’s address bar is the remote access address for that device.

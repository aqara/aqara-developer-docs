This guide explains how to connect Aqara devices to Aqara Studio through Aqara Cloud.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:
- You have already added your Aqara devices to the Aqara Home App.
- Both your Aqara device and the Aqara Edge Hub M300 are in the same home in the Aqara Home App and connected to the same WiFi network.

### Add Devices

1. In the left sidebar, go to the **Devices** page.
2. In the protocol directory on the left, double-click the **Aqara** folder to see the **Device Discover** tab.
3. Click **Discovery**, and Aqara Studio will use Aqara Cloud to automatically find the devices in your Aqara Home App.
4. Select the devices you want to add, and click the "+" button in the center. The newly added devices will appear in the **Added Devices** list on the right.
5. Click the refresh button in the protocol directory on the left to see all newly added devices under the Aqara folder.

## Next Steps

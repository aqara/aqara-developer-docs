# BACnet

This document explains how to connect BACnet devices to Aqara Studio.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, please make sure your network meets these conditions based on your device type:
- For BACnet/IP devices: The BACnet/IP device, Aqara gateway, and your computer must be on the same local area network (LAN).
- For BACnet MS/TP devices: The BACnet MS/TP device is already connected to a BACRouter, and the BACRouter, Aqara gateway, and your computer are all on the same LAN.

## Add a BACnet Device

1. On the left sidebar, click to enter the **Devices** page.
2. In the sidebar, click the “+” button. In the popup, choose `BACnet IP` to add a `BACnet IP` folder.
3. Double-click the `BACnet IP` folder to open the BACnet IP protocol management page.
4. Go to the `Configuration` tab and set the following parameters for this protocol:

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
   
4. Click the “Discovery” button. Aqara Studio will then scan the network to find devices.

    :::tip
    If Aqara Studio does not find your BACnet device, you can also [add the device manually](#how-to-handle-bacnet-devices-not-discovered-by-aqara-studio).
    :::

5. Select the devices you want to add and click the center **+** button to add the BACnet device.

6. In the left sidebar, double-click the device you just added to enter its configuration page. Go to the `Point discovery` tab and click `Discovery`. Aqara Studio will begin scanning to discover function points for this device.

    > **Note**
    >
    > If the system does not discover the function points you need, you can also [add them manually](#how-to-handle-bacnet-points-not-discovered-by-aqara-studio).

7. Depending on whether you need to modify the discovered points, you can add points in two ways:
    - No modification needed: Select the points needed and click the "+" button to finish adding.
    - Need to modify: Double-click the point, and in the popup, you can modify the point’s information.

        The details for each parameter are shown in this table:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parameter</th>

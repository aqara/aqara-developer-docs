# View and Control Function Points

This article explains how to view and operate device function points in Aqara Studio. You will learn how to check real-time status and control devices by writing function point parameters.

## Steps

1. Go to the **Devices** page. In the device tree on the left, find the device folder you want to view.
2. Double-click the device folder to open the device **Essential** tab.
3. In the "Point Information" section, you will see several function point cards. Each function point represents a parameter or status of the device.
    - **Read-Only Function Points**: Shown as non-editable cards. Examples include power meter readings, voltage, air quality, temperature, and others. You can only view their real-time data.
    - **Writable Function Points**: Shown as editable cards. Examples include air conditioner temperature, fan mode, light brightness, and so on. You can change these parameters directly to control the device.

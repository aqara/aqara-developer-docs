In a smart home system, a device or point is often linked to spaces, other devices, communication protocols, or automation processes. In Aqara Studio, you can easily view detailed reference information for any device or point. This includes its associated space, the device it belongs to, related protocols, and any automation flows it participates in. These details help you fully understand the dependencies between devices, making management and maintenance easier.
